    <h1>About demetsiiify</h1>
    <p>
      This application allows you to create fresh new
      <a href="http://iiif.io">IIIF</a>
      <a href="http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/">manifests</a> from
      your dusty old
      <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">METS</a>/<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">MODS</a> files.
      Why? Because XML is so 90ies and curly braces are prettier than pointed ones...<br>
      Just kidding, having a IIIF manifests opens a lot of possibilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can now create and share annotations on your digitized works
          (they are stored on our server, but they can be viewed from anywhere)</li>
      <li>Since IIIF is Linked Data all the way down, you get free permalinks
          to all parts of the object</li>
      <li>With Mirador, you can compare objects from multiple sources
          side-by-side in the same window</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The application is currently a <strong>work-in-progress</strong> and has only been
      tested with METS/MODS files that follow the <a
      href="http://dfg-viewer.de/profil-der-metadaten/">recommendations of
      the German Research Foundation (DFG)</a>. If you want to give it a spin,
      pick an object from the <a href="http://zvdd.de">Central Directory of
      Digitized Prints</a> and submit the URL to the METS on the front page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the venerable <a href="http://dfg-viewer.de">DFG-Viewer</a>
      is based on METS, you can also put a DFG-Viewer URL into the input box
      and the application will extract the URL of the corresponding METS
      document by itself.

    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>How does this work? Are you hosting all the images yourself?</dt>
      <dd>
        <strong>No.</strong> <em>demetsiiify</em> merely <strong>redirects</strong>
        to the original image resources on the libraries' servers. The only
        information it stores are the generated IIIF manifests and information
        (dimensions, format) about the available images in each manifest.
        Under the hood this works by offering <a href="http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/compliance/">Level 0</a>
        <tt>info.json</tt> files for each page that lists the available sizes
        for a given page. If the client then makes a request to the IIIF endpoint
        corresponding to that size, it will be redirected to the actual image
        on the library's servers.
      </dd>
      <dt>Why does it take so long to generate a manifest?</dt>
      <dd>
        This is due to the fact that the <a href="">IIIF Presentation API</a>
        mandates that the dimension (in pixels) of each <em>canvas</em> (i.e.
        a single page) be known in advance. Unfortunately this information is
        not contained in the METS document, so we have to grab every single
        referenced image from the METS to obtain its dimensions, which can
        take a while. This information is cached in the database, so when
        you re-submit the METS (e.g. because some metadata has changed),
        it will be much quicker.
      </dd>
      <dt>Why are you hammering my library's servers?</dt>
      <dd>
        See the above question. If you have an API that allows for the querying
        of the image dimensions without grabbing the actual image,
        <a href="mailto:johannes.baiter@gmail.com">get in touch</a>, maybe
        we can do something about it (or submit a pull request!).
      </dd>
      <dt>I work for a library, can we use this for our production services?</dt>
      <dd>
        Absolutely! If you're fine with the data being hosted elsewhere,
        you can just use the manifests on this server. If you want to self-host
        the application, it is available at <a href="https://github.com/jbaiter/demetsiiify">GitHub</a>
        under an AGPL license. If you want different licensing terms or
        proprietary customisations, please get in touch and I'm sure we can work
        something out.
